                    turbine based of external control variables with good accuracy and robustness. Ideally this type of model could be employed by power industry for
                    understanding and predicting energy loads in different ambient/climate conditions.", style="text-align: justify;")),
          
          p(tags$h5("The basic understanding of regression is concerned with formulating a relationship between a dependent variable (single variable whose
                    value is to be predicted) and one or more independent or control variables. It may happen that independent variables are not truly orthogonal
                    and may have interdependencies like for example process variables in complex chemical filtration plant. we don't just predict the outcome; we
                    also have an understanding of how variability in individual drivers/control parameters affect the outcome variable. Specifically linear regression
                    is used to estimate a continuous value as a linear (additive) function of other variables, this function can be then used as empirical relation to
                    predict outcome for that particular problem. This function has a set of coefficients associated with it indicative of the relative impact of each
                    input driver. The input or predictor variable can be continuous, discrete or categorical. Simple linear regression is the preferred method
                    for almost any problem where outcome is continuous, this method is tried before trying any complicated approach. After data collection, we
                    have pairs of observations , each having one response and predictor variable values. The idea is to formulate a best fit line which represents
                    this scatter data as closely as possible, this is done by estimating unknown parameters of linear equation by minimizing the residual values, one
                    of such parameters of evaluation is least squares method. Further, the generated model should be evaluated. This is done by calculating coefficient
                    of determination (R-squared value) and root mean squared error for prediction (RMSEP). ", style="text-align: justify;"))

                  formulation of domain, and its purely data driven approach. Which helps someone from minimal domain knowledge to make decision. The main motivation
                  for me was to take this sensor data and formulate a model which could predict turbine energy yield based of ambient climate parameters. This could
                  be a really helpful tool, where we can predict energy output of a power plant based of various external out of control parameters. This could

                    and GTEP (1). These are the predictor factors which have significant effect on variability of TEY. The multivariate best fit model for target
                    variable has good fit with slope of fit line around ~ 0.98 and RSME of 0.735. Many a times model may overfit and lead to wrongful results.
                    That was not observed here. It was observed that, target values were getting grouped/clustered into three seperate regions with respect to TEY value for ambient predictor
                    variables like AP, AT, AH as indicated by simple linear regression tabs plot. This shows how ambient conditions affect and control efficiency
                    and yields of gas turbines. Further, this model can be used to map favorable ambient condition ranges to attain high energy yields.
